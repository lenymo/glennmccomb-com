{{< lead >}}In early March of 2020 after months of searching and hunting, right before the Coronavirus lockdown kicked off in Australia, I bought my first ever 7-string - a [Schecter C-7 Apocalypse](https://www.schecterguitars.com/guitars/c-7-apocalypse-rusty-grey-detail).{{< /lead >}}

It's a _great_ guitar, check out the photos!

When I started my search I wasn't looking for a 7-string, but the more I researched, the more I began to think I'd like the extra range. I started out with my heart set on an Ibanez. My first ever guitar was an Ibanez so it made sense to stick to familiar territory.

I loved the look of the natural finish on the Ibanez [RGA60AL](https://www.ibanez.com/na/products/detail/rga60al_1p_01.html) and in fact, if it came in a 7-string I probably would have bought it. I also looked long and hard at the RGAIX7U (which has a similar natural wood finish) but alas, it is not stocked in Australia - much like many of Ibanez's 7-strings. I am not a fan of the RGD style at all, so while I gave them a go in store, I never seriously considered them.

Next up I came across the [PRS Mark Holcomb Satin Walnut](https://www.prsguitars.com/electrics/model/se_mark_holcomb_svn_2020). I became fully obsessed with this one for some months. I played one in store, but the neck pickup didn't work at all due to a manufacturing fault and had to be returned to PRS. 

I waited 6 weeks for some more units to arrive but in the meantime I became aware of [a fairly serious fret buzz issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B2tyS_fJh4) with the low B-string. I played two different guitars in store and they both had the same issue. Ultimately, as much as I loved the guitar I couldn't something that significant.

During my months obsessing over the Holcomb I came across the C7 Apocalypse, but it was a fair way outside my price range. Then, one day while combing the websites of the music stores in my local area, I came across a deal which I literally thought was a misprint. I went in store to play it the very next day and ended up walking out with that guitar plus a genuine Schecter case for the same cost as the Holcomb sig.

I played various other (much more expensive) guitars throughout my search, but nothing had the same clarity and bite as the Schecter and it has not let me down since. The stock Schecter pickups sound very nice to my admittedly inexperienced ear.

And that's the story of how I ended up with a C-7 Apocalypse.
